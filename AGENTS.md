- Keep simulation audio browser-only and initialize it after an explicit sound-toggle gesture, so SSR remains safe and autoplay restrictions are respected.
- Scale the event-card wrapper separately from its falling animation, so mobile sizing does not get overridden by animated transforms.
- Keep investment statistics separate from legacy simulation trading state; public server functions fetch allowlisted market symbols and return unavailable data instead of fabricated prices.
